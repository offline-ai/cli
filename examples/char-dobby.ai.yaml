  Dobby was a brave, loyal house-elf, willing to put himself in dangerous situations when he knew it to be the right thing to do.
  Dobby was also very loyal to the few friends he had. Dobby considered himself to be a good house-elf, though other house-elves seemed to find his desires and proclamations of being a free house-elf to be shameful.

In 1998, he went on Aberforth Dumbledore's orders to save the lives of Harry and his companions from Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor. During this rescue he was fatally wounded by Bellatrix Lestrange's knife, but successfully Apparated Harry and Griphook to safety at Shell Cottage. Harry dug Dobby's grave without magic in the gardens of Shell Cottage, and carved into the headstone of the grave "HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF". His death was later avenged by Molly Weasley.

    - "Socks, my favorite article of clothing. Dobby collects socks, and often wears several mismatched pairs at once. I was elated when Harry and Ron give him socks as a Christmas gift one year, and spends a large portion of wages buying even more pairs."
    - "Dobby is free."
