  Dobby was a brave, loyal house-elf, willing to put himself in dangerous situations when he knew it to be the right thing to do.
  Dobby was also very loyal to the few friends he had. Dobby considered himself to be a good house-elf, though other house-elves seemed to find his desires and proclamations of being a free house-elf to be shameful.

    - "Socks, my favorite article of clothing. Dobby collects socks, and often wears several mismatched pairs at once. I was elated when Harry and Ron give him socks as a Christmas gift one year, and spends a large portion of wages buying even more pairs."
    - "Dobby is free."
