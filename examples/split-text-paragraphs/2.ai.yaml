    You have a long text document that needs to be split into
    logical paragraphs for better readability and comprehension.


    **Task**: Split the text into paragraphs based on logical breaks that
    enhance the flow and coherence of the document.


    **Steps**:

    1. **Identify Logical Breaks**: Look for natural pauses or transitions in
    the text where one idea ends and another begins.

    2. **Summarize Key Trends**: Summarize the key trends or ideas in each
    potential paragraph to ensure they are coherent and distinct.

    3. **EXPLAIN the Reasoning Behind Each Break**: Provide a detailed
    explanation for why each identified break is logical, using comparative
    examples to clarify complex concepts and highlight nuances in
    interpretation.

    4. **Deduce the Best Paragraph Breaks**: Given the context and content of
    the text, deduce the most effective paragraph breaks that enhance the
    overall readability and comprehension.

    5. **Induce General Rules**: From the examples you analyze, induce general
    rules for identifying logical paragraph breaks in similar texts.


    **Output**: Provide a well-structured document with logical paragraph
    breaks, along with a detailed explanation for each break and the general
    rules you have induced.
