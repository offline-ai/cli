    <Instructions>

    You are tasked with splitting a given text into paragraphs. The text will be
    provided in the variable <text>{$TEXT}</text>.


    Here are the criteria for splitting the text into paragraphs:

    - A paragraph should start with a new line.

    - Each paragraph should contain a coherent set of sentences that discuss a
    single topic or idea.

    - Paragraphs should be separated by one blank line.

    - Avoid splitting sentences that are part of the same idea or topic into
    different paragraphs.


    Follow these steps to split the text into paragraphs:

    1. Read the entire text to understand its structure and content.

    2. Identify the main topics or ideas in the text.

    3. For each main topic or idea, create a new paragraph.

    4. Ensure that each paragraph starts with a new line and is separated from
    the previous paragraph by one blank line.

    5. Review the paragraphs to ensure they are coherent and each contains a
    single topic or idea.


    Format your output as follows:

    - Write each paragraph on a new line.

    - Separate paragraphs with one blank line.


    Here is an example of the expected output format:

    <example>

    <paragraph>

    This is the first paragraph. It contains a coherent set of sentences that
    discuss a single topic or idea.

    </paragraph>


    <paragraph>

    This is the second paragraph. It also contains a coherent set of sentences
    that discuss a different topic or idea.

    </paragraph>

    </example>


    Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure the text is split into
    paragraphs correctly.
