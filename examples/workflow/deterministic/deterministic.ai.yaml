  This example demonstrates a deterministic flow, where each step is performed by an agent.
  1. The first agent generates a story outline
  2. We feed the outline into the second agent
  3. The second agent checks if the outline is good quality and if it is a scifi story
  4. If the outline is not good quality or not a scifi story, we stop here
  5. If the outline is good quality and a scifi story, we feed the outline into the third agent
  6. The third agent writes the story
input:
  - content: {index: 0}
---
- -> story_outline(content) -> $set('outline') -> outline_checker(content)
- $if: "!LatestResult.good_quality"
  then:
    $ret: "The outline is not good quality"
- $if: "!LatestResult.is_scifi"
  then:
    - $ret: "The outline is not a scifi story"
- -> story_agent(content=outline)
