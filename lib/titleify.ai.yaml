  Summarize the content or a text file into a single best title that captures the essence of the document.
  It takes a filepath as input and outputs a concise title that reflects the main theme or content.

  It can be used in prompt. eg, `Title: @titleify(file=document.md)`

  Or, run it directly:

  ```bash
  $ai run -f titleify "{file: 'document.md'}"
  ````
tag:
  - titleify

input:
  - content                  # The content to titleify or treat as user input
  - file                     # The text file path if exists, it will load content from the file
  - len: {type: "number"}    # the optional max length of the title. It is not precise, just an approximate number.
  - temperature              # the optional temperature of the LLM.
output:
  type: "string"
len: -1                      # the default max length of the title, -1 means no limit
temperature: 0.01            # the default temperature of the LLM.
