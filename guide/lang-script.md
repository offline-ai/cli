# Programmable Prompt Engine(PPE) Language Script Capabilities

Programmable Prompt Engine(PPE) Language is a message-processing language, similar to the YAML format.

PPE is designed to define AI prompt messages and their input/output configurations. It allows for the creation of a reusable and programmable prompt system akin to software engineering practices.

* Message-Based: PPE revolves around defining interactions as a series of messages. Each message has a `role` (e.g., `system`, `assistant`, `user`) and the actual `message content`.
* YAML-Like: PPE uses a syntax similar to YAML, making it human-readable and relatively easy to learn.
* Dialogue Separation: Triple dashes (`---`) or asterisks (`***`) clearly mark the beginning of new dialogue turns, ensuring context is managed effectively.

## Chains Invocation of Agent Scripts Or Instructions

Within messages, results can be forwarded to other agents.

If no parameters are specified, the AI outcome will be passed as the `content` parameter to the agent. For instance,

`list-expression.ai.yaml`:

```yaml
system: Only list the calculation expression, do not calculate the result
---
user: "Three candies plus five candies."
assistant: "[[CalcExpression]]"
# The actual input to the agent in this case is: {content: "[AI-generated calculation expression]"}
-> calculator
$echo: "#A total of {{LatestResult}} pieces of candy"
```

`calculator.ai.yaml`:


```yaml
---
# Below is the front-matter configuration
parameters:
  response_format:
    type: "json"
output:
  type: "number"
---
# Below is the script
system: Please as a calculator to calculate the result of the following expression. Only output the result.
--- # mark the beginning of new dialogue
user: "{{content}}"
```

When parameters are included, the AI `content` is combined with these parameters and forwarded together to the agent. For example,

```yaml
user: "Tell me a joke!"
assistant: "[[JOKE]]"
# The actual input to the agent here is: {content: "[This is a joke generated by AI]", target_lang: "Portuguese"}
-> translator(target_lang="Portuguese") -> $print
```

**Note**:

* Call internal instruction with `$` prefix
* If the script returns a value of type `string`/`boolean`/`number`, that return value will be placed to the `content` field. If the return value is an `object`, its contents will be directly passed to the agent.

### Script File and Directory

A PPE script can be a single file or an entire directory. If it is a file, the filename must end with `.ai.yaml`. If it's a directory, it must contain a script file with the same name as the directory to serve as the entry point. Additionally, other script files within the same directory can call each other.

For example, if there is a directory named `a-dir`, the entry point script file should be named `a-dir/a-dir.ai.yaml`.

### Essential Tips

* Script Return Value: The script's final command's output determines its return value.
* Auto-Execution: Scripts ending with prompts but no explicit `$AI` call will automatically execute `$AI` at the end, configurable via `autoRunLLMIfPromptAvailable`.
* Output Mode: Scripts default to streaming output, can disable it using the `--no-stream` switch
  * Note: not all LLM backends support streaming output.
